       <p> This is a JPG image of Lamar Jackson from the Baltimore Ravens. This
        image shows some of his highlights, such as his photos of himself in the regular season. I picked this image because Lamar is my favorite quarterback in the league, it's one of my favorite pictures of him.
       </p>
